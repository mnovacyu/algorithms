# Fundamentals
algorithm - a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program


## 1.1 Basic Programming Model
Java Program (class) - either a *library of static methods* (functions) or a *data type definition*

Consists of seven components:
1. primitive data types - int, real number, bool etc
1. statements - decs, assignmts, conditionals, loops, calls, returns
1. arrays - work with mult vals of the same type
1. static methods - encapsulate & reuse code
1. strings - seq of chars
1. input/output - set up comm between progs and outside world
1. data abstraction - extends encapsultn
    - reuse to allow to def non-primitive data types
    - support OOP
